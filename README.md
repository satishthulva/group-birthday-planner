# group birthday planner
Birthday planner for groups. Provide birthdays of all people with in a closely knit group in a file. When a persons' birthday is approaching, groupbirthdayplanner will send a reminder email to all of his/her friends.

Java based Webapp. Right now, UI is not there yet. Backend is being developed. Still early days. Functionality is there to register a group and send notification.

Right now, there's facility to send a reminder email only. The plan is to exapnd this into a full-pledged planner. Starting with what gift to give, plan the day etc.
